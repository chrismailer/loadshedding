### How does it work?
Add an area to your calendar. This will update automatically with the latest load-shedding periods. You can add as many areas as you want.

Oh and it's free, no ads.


### Support
Only [Cape Town](https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-electricity-services/Load-shedding-and-outages) is supported at the moment, but more areas on their way!
Tested with _Apple Calendar_, _Google Calendar_, and _Outlook_.
